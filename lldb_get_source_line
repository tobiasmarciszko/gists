First you need to find the address of the method itself.

(lldb) image lookup -v -F "-[ViewController myMethod]"
"range = [0x000708c0-0x00070c6c)"
(where 0x000708c0 is address of method)

Now to add the given offset of 47, just use LLDB to do that math for you:

(lldb) p/x 0x000708c0 + 47
(int) $0 = 0x000708ef
and you get your answer, the offending line is on 0x000708ef

(lldb) source list -a `addr + offset`
(lldb) source list -a `0x000708c0 + 47`
